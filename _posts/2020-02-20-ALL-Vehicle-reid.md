### CVPR2019 workshop papers

- **(1. Baidu ZeroOne)** 
  - Methods
    - Using 3 types of image feature and additional video feature assisted by tracking algorithms
    - Image feature **(regular training step with training set)**
      - 1) global feature (linear transform. of the pooling feature of last conv.) + self-attention constrain [1] (for paying more attention to the spatial regions)
      - 2) Region feature (multiple granularities network [2] for learning more semantic parts)
      - 3) Point feature (extract feature around these keypoint by Keypoint detection [3])
    - Video feature **(post-processing step that applies at the distance matrix between query feature $$q_i$$ and gallery feature $$g_j$$.)**
      - Limitation of image-based re-id: Large intra-class variations and similar inter-class appearances
      - Multi-camera tracking step can provide each vehicle tracklet
      - Each query and gallery image corresponds to a tracklet, so camera info. and duration can be obtained.
      - Refine the distance matrix using simple and effective constraints
        - If $$q_i$$ and $$g_j$$ are **some below conditions**, we push them.
        - 1) condition A: same camera & different ID (This constraint can filter lots of false positives that are similar with a certain
query in appearance and direction)
        - 2) condition B: same camera (scenario 2) & similar direction (when two direction probability vectors are similar,
the corresponding query and gallery are likely to be different vehicles)
        - 3) condition C: similar car type (multi-task branches: ID + type classification / trained by attribute-extended CityFlow-ReID [4]) & distance over a certain value (two vehicles with different car types are matched as the same one with a high confidence in camera 35)
        - 4) condition D: maximum elapsed time of the gallery and query tracklet is greater than the estimated elapsed time of the camera (time difference must be less than an estimated time window when a vehicle moves from one camera to another)
    - Extra group distance
      - We can get the group split of all gallery images (by combining the provided the tracklet info. of CityFlow-ReID [4] and the results of multi-camera tracking)
      - For each group, find the smallest distance value and add it to all pairs in the group. (weighted sum)
    - Re-ranking with k-reciprocal encoding [5] 
      - Several false positives reoccur after reranking, so constraints are applied again to exclude bad cases
  - Training
    - CityFlow-ReiD is split into two parts (model selection & parameter learning)
    - Initial model (for validation): train with 333-50 identities / evaluate with 50 identities on CitiFlow-ReID
    - Final model (for test): train with 30000+ identities (VehicleID [7] + collection from Internet) / fine-tune with 333 identities on CityFlow-ReID & a fine-grained vehicle classification dataset (Cars) [6]
    - Data refinement
      - Tight bounding box generated by vehicle detector to decrease the interference of background
      - Most models are trained on both datasets (original + refined ver.)
    - Annotation
      - Attribute-extended CityFlow-ReID (8 direction + 5 attributes including color, type, roof rack, sky window, logo)
      - Most attributes are not robust in exp. and only the type attribute is used in the final solution
    - Model
      - The normalized features of all models are concatenated
      - Global feature (seresnext101 + resnet101 + resnet152 + hrnet32) + Self-attention constrain (resnet101)
      - Region feature (resnet101)
      - Point feature (seresnext101)
