# UNIT 

- Definition
  - Image-to-image translation: mapping an image in one domain to a corresponding image in another domain
  - Unsupervised I2I: there exist no paired examples
- Challenging issues in I2I problems
  - I2I problem: key challenge is to learn a joint distribution of images in different domains (probabilistic modeling perspective)
  - Unsupervised I2I problem: two sets consist of images from two marginal distributions (diff modal) $$\rightarrow$$ to finer the joint distribution
  - The coupling theory [2]: there exist an infinite set of joint distributions that can arrive the given marginal distributions in general
    - Therefore, inferring the joint distribution from the marginal distributions is a highly ill-posed problem
- Proposed method: make a *shared-latent space assumption*
  - A pair of corresponding images in different domains can be mapped to a same latent representation $$z$$ in a shared-latent space $$\mathRR{X}$$
  - Basic concept: coupled GAN [3]
